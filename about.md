This page was created as a personal blog to ramble. I usually do it in different languages, both unnatural and otherwise. Since I enjoy pushing boundaries, some exagerations might appear here and there. I will try to mostly use short words, which are the ones I enjoy the most.

Content itself might vary to include:

* Words in Spanish
* Thoughts about things that one can think about
* Stuff about computer graphics
* Nonsense, but of the not fun kind
* Contempt for the English language

Since I lack the amount of self awareness needed to say who I am well enough, you can imagine me in whatever way you want. I think it might be funnier that way. I would ask your imagination to give me a few attributes you enjoy, just so you can more easily enjoy what I do.

The blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a variation of the Trio theme by [Ankur Gupta](https://github.com/ankur-gupta).
