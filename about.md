I made this site to have a space to ramble. I am not sure what it will contain over time, since I have odd interests that splurge and intersect from time to time. 

Letting the stuff flow is the way this whole site will roll. I might use small and big words, spanish, english and computer words and even made up words. That should be descriptive enough.

The blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a variation of the Trio theme by [Ankur Gupta](https://github.com/ankur-gupta).
