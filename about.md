This page was created as a personal blog to ramble. I usually do it in different languages, both unnatural and otherwise. Since I enjoy pushing boundaries, some exagerations might appear here and there. I will try to mostly use short words, which are the ones I enjoy the most.



The blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a variation of the Trio theme by [Ankur Gupta](https://github.com/ankur-gupta).
