I made this site to have a space to discuss whatever it is I find interesting. Often, it will be
about things I create, be it in bits or in atoms. Other times, it will just be terrible.

The blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a variation of the Trio theme by
[Ankur Gupta](https://github.com/ankur-gupta).
