Just a simple entry to make sure everything works.

[Here](/projects/renderer/) you can see software rasterizer I wrote in Scala.js. It's not 
very fast, probably. I didn't clip the triangles so it lags (badly!) when they are behind your eyes.

---------

Disregard the following lists simply because you're busy:

* Once upon a time Zeno went to $$\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i}$$ and then it was 
twice upon a time
* Spanish is nice because life's a dream
* I can't use long words

1. Look
2. See what's going on
3. Repeat

And ignore the following code:

```scala
    def UniversalSolver(any: Problem): Solution = {
        ???
    }
```

Thanks! For my last trick I shall show an image down below:
