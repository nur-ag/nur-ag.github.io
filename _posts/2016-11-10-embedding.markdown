Just a simple entry to make sure everything works.

This cube rotates in a software rasterizer I wrote in Scala.js. It's not very fast, probably. Turn around to feel the effect of not clipping the triangles:

Disregard the following lists because you're busy:

* Once upon a time Zeno went to $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i}$ and then it was twice upon a time
* Spanish is nice because life's a dream
* I can't use long words

1. Look
2. See what's going on
3. Repeat

And ignore the following code:

```scala
    def UniversalSolver(any: Problem): Solution = {
        ???
    }
```

Thanks! For my last trick I shall show an image down below:
